This script is designed to enforce ownership and permission settings on a 
wordpress or drupal webroot. Permissions are defined in the 3 dimensional array 
called $desired_settings. Both simple, 3-digit, permissions and full 4-digit
permissions are supported. The sticky bit is set by default on most of the
specifically defined directories. All files are checked first to see if any settings 
need to be changed; if so, changes are attempted. Both successes and failures
are logged (log file is ./setown.log). Failures also generate error messages in 
STDOUT.

I chose to make this script examine and act on individual files rather than
recursively on directories so that I could log every change and whether or not 
it was successful. But that design choice leads to very poor performance when
there are lots of changes to make. For now, unfortunately, you just have to
live with that. At some point I'm planning to add a "simple" flag, that will
instead act recusively on directories, and not log so verbosely.
