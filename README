This script is designed to enforce ownership settings on a wordpress or
drupal webroot. Permissions are defined n the 3 dimensional array called
$desired_settings. All files are checked first to see if any settings need
to be changed; if so, changes are attempted. Both successes and failures
are logged (log file is ./setown.log). Failures also generate error
messages in STDOUT.
